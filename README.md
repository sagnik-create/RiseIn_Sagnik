MultiSigWallet Module
Overview
The MultiSigWallet module is a smart contract written in Move that allows for the creation of a multi-signature wallet. A multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet requires multiple users (signers) to approve a transaction before it can be executed. This provides an additional layer of security, as transactions must be approved by a specified number of signers (threshold) before they are carried out.

Features
Wallet Initialization: The wallet is initialized with a list of signers and a threshold, representing the minimum number of approvals required to execute a transaction.

Transaction Proposal: Any signer can propose a transaction. The transaction will remain pending until the required number of approvals is reached.

Transaction Approval: Signers can approve the proposed transaction. Once the approval threshold is met, the transaction is executed.

Code Structure
Structs
Wallet:

signers: A list of addresses that can approve transactions.
threshold: The minimum number of approvals required to execute a transaction.
approvals: A map that keeps track of which signers have approved the current transaction.
transaction: An optional struct representing the transaction currently pending approval.
PendingTransaction:

to: The address to which the funds will be sent.
amount: The amount of funds to be transferred.
approvals_count: The number of approvals the transaction has received so far.
Functions
initialize:

Initializes a new multi-sig wallet with the provided list of signers and approval threshold.
Parameters:
account: The account (signer) initializing the wallet.
signers: A list of addresses that will be able to approve transactions.
threshold: The minimum number of approvals required to execute a transaction.
propose_transaction:

Proposes a new transaction for the wallet.
Automatically counts the proposerâ€™s approval.
Parameters:
sender: The signer proposing the transaction.
to: The address to which funds will be transferred.
amount: The amount of funds to be transferred.
approve_transaction:

Approves the current pending transaction. If the approval threshold is met, the transaction is executed.
Parameters:
sender: The signer approving the transaction.
Error Handling
The module uses assertions to ensure the following:

The threshold must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the number of signers.
Only one transaction can be pending approval at a time.
Only signers listed in the wallet can approve transactions.
Signers cannot approve the same transaction more than once.
Workflow
Initialize the Wallet:

A signer initializes the wallet by providing a list of signer addresses and a threshold for approvals.
Propose a Transaction:

Any signer can propose a transaction specifying the recipient and amount. This transaction is now pending approval.
Approve the Transaction:

Other signers can approve the pending transaction. Once the number of approvals reaches the threshold, the transaction is executed, transferring the specified amount to the recipient.
Usage Example
Initialize the Wallet:

move
Copy code
MultiSigWallet::initialize(&account, vector[signer1, signer2, signer3], 2);
Propose a Transaction:

move
Copy code
MultiSigWallet::propose_transaction(&account, recipient_address, 1000);
Approve the Transaction:

move
Copy code
MultiSigWallet::approve_transaction(&account);
Conclusion
The MultiSigWallet module provides a secure and flexible way to manage transactions requiring approval from multiple parties. This is particularly useful for organizations or groups where trust is distributed among multiple members. The module ensures that transactions are only executed when a consensus is reached, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized or fraudulent activities.
